<p class-"lead"> As an adjunct instructor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at the Andrew Young School, I have developed and taught courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2015, I was responsible for teaching Introduction to Policy Analysis to seniors with public policy majors. In 2016, I have taught Microeconomics for Public Policy to MPA and MPP students. Also, I have been a teaching assistant for a graduate level course on research methods and applied statistics for two semesters.

<p class-"lead"> My primary teaching interests are in the area of public financial management, policy analysis, and program evaluation. I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Public Policy with a focus on issues related to public finance and budgeting, so I am qualified to teach courses in the related areas. I also have graduate training in Development Studies and have worked for over three years at research and academic institutions on issues related to social and urban policy. Thus, I will be interested in teaching courses related to economic development and social policy.
