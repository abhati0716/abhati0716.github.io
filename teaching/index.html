	<p class-"lead"> As an adjunct instructor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at the Andrew Young School, I have developed and taught courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2015, I was responsible for teaching a course on Policy Analysis to seniors with public policy majors. In 2016, I have taught Microeconomics for Public Policy to MPA and MPP students. In addition, I have been a teaching assistant for a graduate level course on research methods and applied statistics for two semesters. </p> </span>
