<p class-"lead"> My principal research interests lie at the intersection of nonprofits studies and social policy. I am particularly interested in how nonprofits organizations engage with different stakeholders such as donors and beneficiaries and how representation of beneficiaries in fundraising material has effect on how donors and public understands and constructs the identity of poor. My dissertation is in interaction of strong theoretical framework looking at postcolonial theory and its roots in constructing the ‘Other’ and experiment design to understand if representation of the poor in fundraising campaigns leads to stereotyping and racial biasness of people of color using <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/"> Implicit Association Test. </a>
