<p class-"lead"> As an adjunct instructor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at the Andrew Young School, I have developed and taught courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2015, I was responsible for teaching <a href="/files/4061.pdf"> Introduction to Policy Analysis</a> to seniors with public policy majors. In 2016, I have taught <a href="/files/8141.pdf"> Microeconomics for Public Policy</a>  to MPA and MPP students. Also, I have been a teaching assistant for a graduate level course on Applied Research Methods and Statistics for two semesters.
