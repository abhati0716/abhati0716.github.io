<p class-"lead"> My principal research interests lie at the intersection of public finance and social policy. I am particularly interested in the functioning of the subnational governments and institutional reforms to promote equitable and efficient public good provision. My three-essay dissertation examines the relationship between fiscal institutions, public expenditures, and debt. I also work on issues related to employment and poverty and have published articles and comments in this area in academic journals and popular media outlets.
