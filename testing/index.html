<p class-"lead"> My primary teaching interests are in the area of public financial management, policy evaluation, and research methods. I am pursuing my PhD with a focus on issues related to public finance and budgeting, so I am qualified to teach the related courses. I also have worked for over three years at research and academic institutions on issues related to social and urban policy. Thus, I am interested in teaching courses related to economic development and social policy.
