<p class-"lead"> My primary teaching interests are in the area of public financial management, policy analysis and evaluation, and research methods. I am pursuing my PhD with a focus on issues related to public finance and budgeting, so I am qualified to teach the related courses. I am an affliate of the Center for Excellence and Teaching and Learning and received a Certificate of Excellence in College Teaching.
