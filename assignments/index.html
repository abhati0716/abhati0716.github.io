<p class-"lead"> >In my teaching, I try to structure the learning process around studentâ€™s experiences and their observations of the real world problems. One of the essential components of the policy related courses that I have taught is semester long policy projects that require the application of core concepts in a local environment. In the policy world, we also need some distinct skills such as group work, ability to talk across disciplines, and concise writing and presentations. The course assignments and projects are usually structured to facilitate the development of these skills. In the last two years, the students have worked on a variety of policy issues and have found the project experience to be enjoyable and useful.
