<p class-"lead"> Below are some comments from my students:

.
</p>

<p class-"lead"> "He is a very good instructor, he is able to get through to his students. I knew nothing about Microeconomics before taking his class. But i can say confidently, that i really
learned in his class."
</p>

<p class-"lead"> "The instructor was able to synthesize the viewpoints of a public administrator and an economist, and present theories in layman's terms."
</p>

<p class-"lead"> "The analytical assignments that required application of course concepts really helped me take what was learned in class and understand how I would use it in my future job."
</p>

<p class-"lead"> "The instructor didn't just grade assignments, but also provided constructive feedback which was very helpful. He also provided many resources in addition to the required text."
