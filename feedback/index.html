<p><li><small>"He did a good job of creating a study plan that required students to actually participate and interact, despite the class being online. I think I talked to other students and my professor more than I would have in a regular classroom." - Spring 2016 </small> </li></p>
<p><li><small>"I always received feedback within a day or two. This instructor actually reads my material and appreciates what I have to say. Some weeks were more difficult than others to make the discussion deadline and this instructor was very understanding of a non-traditional student life. I believe all these things were very valuable to my success this semester. Thank you!" - Fall 2016</small> </li></p>
