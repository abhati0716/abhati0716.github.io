<p class-"lead"> In my teaching, I encourage students to apply the core concepts to the real world problems in their socio-political environment. One of the deliverables in the policy related courses is a semester long policy project that requires the application of core concepts to policy problems. In the policy world, we also need some distinct skills such as group work, ability to talk across disciplines, and concise writing and presentations. The course assignments and projects are usually structured to facilitate the development of these skills. In the last two years, the students have worked on a variety of policy issues and have found the assignment and projects to be enjoyable and useful.
